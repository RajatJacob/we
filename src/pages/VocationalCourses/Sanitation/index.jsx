				<p className="info">Adequate sanitation, together with good hygiene and safe water, are fundamental to good health and to social and economic development. Improvements in one or more of these three components of good health can substantially reduce the rates of morbidity and the severity of various diseases and improve the quality of life of huge number of people, particularly children, in developing countries. Although linked and often mutually supporting, these three components have different public health characteristics. This course focuses on spreading awareness to women about community health and sanitation. It seeks to present the latest evidence on the provision of adequate sanitation, to analyse why more progress has not been made, and to suggest strategies to improve the impact of sanitation. </p>
			<h3>Why Sanitation for Women Matters</h3>
			<p className="info">The Sustainable Development Goals to drastically improve the livelihood of people and the planet is very important to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for everybody in the community.
 There are schools which lacks basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, affecting the education of millions of school children, but particularly girls managing menstruation, and one in four health-care facilities worldwide lacked basic water services, affecting more than 2 billion people.
For women delivering a child in these health facilities, a lack of safe water can be fatal for mother and child. Safe water and hygiene for women can reduce the risk of infections and death for infants and mothers by up to 25 percent. Sanitation for women, safe water access, and improved hygiene saves their lives and the lives of their infants, reducing maternal and infant deaths drastically.
Other challenges, such as absenteeism during menstruation and the spread of disease, are also critical problems mitigated by access to basic sanitation. For girls, menstruation can mean an end to their education simply because their schools lack basic female hygiene and sanitation resources. There’s a lack of privacy when urinating or defecating, so many women and girls without a toilet will wait until it’s dark outside to relieve themselves or bathe, which exposes them to attacks.</p>

<h3>Solving the Sanitation Problem for Women</h3>
<p className="info">Safe water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are the most basic building blocks for empowering women everywhere. The three go hand in hand; to truly solve the sanitation problem for women, you need all three.
<br/>At the most basic level, here’s what it takes to provide proper sanitation for women<br/>
<ol>
<li>A toilet with dignity</li>
<p>Building and using a simple pit or pour-flush toilet separates people from poop, drastically decreasing diseases in communities and schools. It also provides safety and dignity for women, giving them a place to go so they no longer have to wait until dark or expose themselves during the day.</p>
<br/>

<li>A hand washing facility</li>
<p className="info">When every home constructs a simple hand washing device and begins using soap, the spread of disease is prevented. For women cleaning up after small children in rural communities, hand washing is critical to health. Plus, access to soap and water allows women and girls to keep themselves clean while menstruating.</p>
<br/>
<li>A safe water source</li>
<p className="info">Safe water is vital to sanitation. Without it, bathrooms and dishes can’t be cleaned, and hands can’t be washed properly. Plus, safe water close by provides relief for women and girls who are often tasked with the burden of carrying heavy loads of water to and from the source. This saves them time and gives them the opportunity to go to school and work.</p>
<br/>
<li>A drying rack</li>
<p className="info">Washing dishes and drying them in the sun, away from animals, helps stop the spread of harmful pathogens. A dish drying rack built from local materials improves sanitation for entire families.

</p><br/>
<li>Menstruation Hygiene Management (MHM) Training</li>
<p className="info">Women and girls experiencing shame for menstruation cycles or who are unaware of how to best care for themselves during their periods face great challenges. Solving the sanitation crisis for women everywhere means changing the narrative about menstruation.

Through Menstruation Hygiene Management Training for girls in schools, available female hygiene products in schools, and lessons on menstruation hygiene management for women in communities, women and girls become confident and capable of managing this very normal, healthy part of life.
